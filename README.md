# archivesspace_export_service

The ArchivesSpace Export Service provides a framework for scheduled EAD export and publication.
It consists of an ArchivesSpace plug-in and an application that uses the ArchivesSpace API but
which is otherwise independent of ArchivesSpace and can be deployed anywhere so long as it has
access to the ArchivesSpace backend.

The ArchivesSpace Export Service was developed by Hudson Molonglo for Yale University.
